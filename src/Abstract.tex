    The reasoning task of a temporal version of \textit{ontology-based data access} can be solved with the help of a \textit{bounded history encoding} (BHE).
    By rewriting temporal queries, the reasoning task can be reduced to query answering over temporal databases.
    The BHE under consideration in this work is one approach to solve this task \cite{borgwardt2015temporalizing}.

    In this thesis, an implementation of this BHE is evaluated, to investigate its helpfulness in a practical application.
    Criteria to assess the degree of helpfulness are the size of the encoding, the time it takes to answer one query per time point, and the usefulness of the answers.
    The BHE is applied to observe an online automotive marketplace and then to answer a set of specified queries at each time point.
    The queries were explicitly chosen to help evaluate the BHE's degree of helpfulness.
    To provide useful answers, the BHE had to be extended by appropriate operators.
    The evaluation of the extended BHE shows that it can provide useful answers in a reasonable time.
    An upper bound was found for the size of the encoding, which determines from what number of time points on the BHE is superior.
